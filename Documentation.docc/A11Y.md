## Overview

When you are building a map, consider the operating system you are building it on.
Use accessibility fonts to enhance label readability.  An operating systems that considers a users accessibility can be a major factor in creating better maps.
Apple MapKit combines good point of interest data with good accessibility for readability.

### Accessibility

- term A11Y: Accessibility, "*Accessibility can be viewed as the 'ability to access' and benefit from some system or entity.*"
- term [Dynamic Type][Dynamic Type]: A feature that lets people choose the size of visible text in iOS, iPadOS, tvOS, visionOS, and watchOS.
- term A11Y in Historical Cartography: Use larger fonts to call out historical aerial imagery.

### Demo 

iOS Dynamic Type Comparison

@TabNavigator {
    @Tab("🗺️ MapKit xS") {
        @Image(source: "iPhone8+xS-MapKit") { }
    }
    
    @Tab("🗺️ MapKit xxxL") {
        @Image(source: "iPhone8+xxxL-MapKit") { }
    }
    
    @Tab("⚙️ Settings xS") {
        @Image(source: "iPhone8+xS-Settings") { }
    }
    
    @Tab("⚙️ Settings xxxL") {
        @Image(source: "iPhone8+xxxL-Settings") { }
    }

    @Tab("🎥 Dynamic Type") {
        @Video(source: "iPhone8+MapKit-with-Dynamic-Type", 
               poster: "iPhone8+Poster", alt: "")
    }
}

### Research

Mapbox & MapLibre style-flavored research questions.

> Research: How to define points of interest to include or exclude on a map.  *Solved via OSM data.*

> 📱 iOS Apple Dynamic Type: How to dynamically increase the `"text-size"` of a `symbol` label based on the Dynamic Type accessibility setting.  *Possibly solved  with MapKit JS*.
>
> Need a solution for MapLibre JS.
