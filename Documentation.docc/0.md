Use aerial imagery as historical cartogrphy.  Presented at the annual *F*ree and *O*pen *S*ource *S*oftware for *G*eospatial, North America Conference. Baltimore, Maryland, October 2023.

## Overview

@Row {
    @Column(size: 2) {
        Raster image or aerial imagery surveys range from those taken in a "modern era" (2014-present), but you can find imagery from 1995 or 1984 or 1936 or maybe older than that.
    }
    
    @Column {
        ![](NJ-Coastal1920)
    }    
}
    
@Row {
    @Column {
        ![](NJ-BlackWhite1930)
    }
    
    @Column(size: 2) {
        Aerial imagery can be found from government agencies. Or, look for sources from the library at a research university.
    }
}

@Row {    
    @Column(size: 2) {
        Open data and open standards to access the data means you can pull aerial imagery into your OSM Web map. Use historical imagery with OSM points of interest to show what your college campus looked like back in the day. Use public domain data to show how your favorite city has changed over the years. And lastly, we will show techniques on how to use aerial imagery on a print map. 
    }

}

@Row {
    @Column {
        ![](NJ-Natural2019)
    }
    
    @Column(size: 2) {
        We will also demonstrate how to layer the style from the OSM Americana project on top of any aerial imagery.
    }
}

@Row {
    @Column(size: 2) {
        We will also show some open source code samples on how to use raster images with leading render platforms such as Mapbox, Leaflet, MapLibre and MapKit.
    }
